A software designed for the visualization of the grational and speed effects of planets in fictional or real systems depending on their mass. It is a free use software created as a college project.

In synsthesis, it is a star system simulator based on several mathematical principles for the calculation of speed in the planets elliptical orbits based on their respective masses.


## Development

The project is made using the Windows UI Framework for the development of the app. In order to edit the project, it is recommend to use **Visual Studio 2022** or higher. It is also recommended to install **.NET 7.0+** on your machine to run it properly. So far, the project is made only for a Windows platform.

To edit the project, the `.sln` and `.csproj` files can be found inside the `src` directory of this repository. Once there, you can edit any individual pages or views from the `src/Pages` directory. All of these are under the root namespace _Morris_.

You can find most of the simulation data and calculations inside the `src/Pages/SimulationPage.xaml.cs` file, as well as the math being inside the `src/Math` directory. 

## Extra information

The project's name is not that of a famous scientist or formula, but that of my dog, Morris:
